# odin_library
Odin Library is the first project in the OOP section of the Odin project JavaScript track. This app allows a user to input a book into the "library" to add to the collection. This uses the object constructor pattern per the prompt of the assignment. A user can toggle the read status of a book and remove it if they wish.
